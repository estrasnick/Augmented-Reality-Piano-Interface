### [Scripts](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloToolkit-Unity/tree/master/Assets/HoloToolkit/SpatialMapping/Scripts)

####[SpatialMappingComponent](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloToolkit-Unity/tree/master/Assets/HoloToolkit/SpatialMapping/Scripts/SpatialMappingComponent)
A unified set of scripts adhering to best practices for providing physics or rendering support for Spatial Mapping.
Add a SpatialMappingCollider or SpatialMappingRenderer component onto a GameObject and spatial mapping will just start working

#### SpatialMappingRenderer.cs
Use this script for rendering Spatial Mapping.

**Rendering Mode**: (Default: **Occlusion**). How to render the mesh. Occlusion will cause the mesh to occlude holograms behind it. Material will apply the specified material. None will cause the meshes to not render at all.

**Rendering Material**: (Default: **Wireframe**). The material to render the Spatial Mapping mesh with. This is only relevant when Rendering Mode is set to Material. The default materials are kept in your Resources\HoloToolkit\ folder.

**Freeze Mesh Updates**: (Default: **no**). When enabled, no further updates will be processed. Use this to delay initial starting of Spatial Mapping processing or to stop updates at a certain point.

**Bounding Volume**: (Default: **Bounding Box**). The shape of the bounds to observe for new surfaces. The choices are Bounding Box with Extents or Sphere with Radius.

**Extents**: (Default: **(10, 10, 10)**). The extents of the bounding box in meters. Only applicable with Bounding Box set for Bounding Volume.

**Radius**: (Default: **10**). The radius of the bounding sphere in meters. Only applicable with Sphere set for Bounding Volume.

**Level of Detail**: (Default: **Medium**). The amount of detail in the resulting meshes. Possible values are Low, Medium, and High. Higher levels of detail will result in lower performance.

**Time Between Updates**: (Default: **2.5**). The frequency in seconds for when updates to Spatial Mapping surfaces will be processed.

#### SpatialMappingCollider.cs
Use this script for performing physics collisions with the Spatial Mapping mesh.

**Enable Collisions**: (Default: **yes**). Whether or not to create a collider for RigidBody physics

**Physic Material**: (Default: **none**). Custom PhysicMaterial to define physical interactions (like bounciness) with the mesh.

**Physics Layer**: (Default: **default**). The layer to apply to the meshes for Raycasting.

**Freeze Mesh Updates**: (Default: **no**). When enabled, no further updates will be processed. Use this to delay initial starting of Spatial Mapping processing or to stop updates at a certain point.

**Bounding Volume**: (Default: **Bounding Box**). The shape of the bounds to observe for new surfaces. The choices are Bounding Box with Extents or Sphere with Radius.

**Extents**: (Default: **(10, 10, 10)**). The extents of the bounding box in meters. Only applicable with Bounding Box set for Bounding Volume.

**Radius**: (Default: **10**). The radius of the bounding sphere in meters. Only applicable with Sphere set for Bounding Volume.

**Level of Detail**: (Default: **Low**). The amount of detail in the resulting meshes. Possible values are Low, Medium, and High. Higher levels of detail will result in lower performance.

**Time Between Updates**: (Default: **2.5**). The frequency in seconds for when updates to Spatial Mapping surfaces will be processed.

#### Design Considerations

1. If you want spatial mapping to work wherever the user travels, attach the components to the camera and the specified bounds will move with the user. 
2. If you want collisions to continue working even after walking away, you may want to leave a second SpatialMappingCollider around the play space where collisions should continue. 
3. If you want physics collisions and to render the Spatial Mapping mesh for an area, you should add both a SpatialMappingCollider and a SpatialMappingRenderer

Though all of the defaults are usable out of the box with no customization, you can also customize the component to your scenario. Through script, additions such as PlaneFinding.cs can also be used with these components.

These components by default implement caching of removed Spatial Mapping meshes such that removed meshes will still be present for at least 10 updates after they are actually removed. 
This number and the feature can be configured via script. This feature enables mesh a great distance from the user to not be removed as well as quick re-hydration of mesh only removed as a user moved away and back to a single location.

The following scripts give you the ability to load the spatial mapping mesh from a file or the network into your Unity scene for debugging in the editor.

#### FileSurfaceObserver.cs
A SpatialMappingSource that loads spatial mapping data from a file in Unity.

**MeshFileName** Name of file to use when saving or loading surface mesh data.

#### MeshSaver.cs

**BoundsExpansion** The amount, if any, to expand each bounding volume by.

#### SimpleMeshSerializer.cs
Static class that converts a Unity mesh to an array of bytes. Used by MeshSaver.cs to serialize and deserialize mesh data.

#### SpatialMappingManager.cs
Manages interactions between the application and all spatial mapping data sources (file, observer, network).

**PhysicsLayer** The physics layer to use for all spatial mapping mesh data.

**SurfaceMaterial** The material to apply when rendering the spatial mapping mesh data.

**DrawVisualMeshes** Determines if spatial mapping meshes will be rendered.

**CastShadows** Determines if spatial mapping meshes can cast shadows.

#### SpatialMappingObserver.cs

**TrianglesPerCubicMeter** Level of detail to use for each mesh found by the SurfaceObserver.

**Extents** Extents of the observation volume which expand out from the camera's position.

**TimeBetweenUpdates** Time to wait (sec) before processing updates from the SurfaceObserver.

#### SpatialMappingSource.cs

**PlaneThickness** How thick each plane should be.

**UpNormalThreshold** Threshold for acceptable normals. Used to determine if a plane is horizontal or vertical.

**FloorBuffer** Max distance from the largest floor plane before a horizontal plane will be classified as a table.

### [Shaders](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloToolkit-Unity/tree/master/Assets/HoloToolkit/SpatialMapping/Shaders)

#### Occlusion.shader
A basic occlusion shader that can be used to occlude objects behind spatial mapping meshes. Use SpatialMappingManager.SetSurfaceMaterial() to use this material with the spatial mapping data.

#### Wireframe.shader
A basic wire frame shader that can be used for rendering spatial mapping meshes. Use SpatialMappingManager.SetSurfaceMaterial() to use this material with the spatial mapping data.

### [Tests](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloToolkit-Unity/tree/master/Assets/HoloToolkit/SpatialMapping/Tests)

#### PlaneFinding.unity
To use this sample code, load the PlaneFinding scene and hit Play. The PlaneFinding algorithm will run in a loop. Switch to the scene view to see a visualization of the planes found.
The PlaneFindingTest component exposes a couple of properties that let you manipulate the PlaneFinding API parameters in real-time and observe their impact on the algorithm.

NOTE: In the interest of simplicity, this test script calls the PlaneFinding APIs directly from the main Unity thread in Update(). 
In a real application, the PlaneFinding APIs **MUST** be called from a background thread in order to avoid stalling the rendering thread and causing a drop in frame rate.

#### SpatialProcessing.unity
The SpatialProcessing scene tests the two processing scripts available in HoloToolkit: SufraceMeshesToPlanes and RemoveSurfaceVertices. 
If you already have a .room file saved, it will automatically load the file and run in Unity. 
If not, you can use the RemoteMapping prefab to send/save mesh files from the HoloLens. You can also run this test directly in the HoloLens.
This scene will scan your area for 15 seconds and then convert all meshes to planes. If a floor plane is found, it will remove vertices from surface meshes that fall within the bounds of any active plane.

#### SpatialMappingComponent\Example.unity
This scene shows an example of a static play space which preserves physics around it (marked by a cube) while maintaining physics and wire frame rendering of Spatial Mapping around the camera. 
Additionally, you can tap to drop a cube in front of the camera with a Rigidbody component to interact with physics.

#### TapToPlace.unity
This scene is the minimum setup to use the TapToPlace script.  It includes GazeManager, GestureManager, and SpatialMapping prefab.  BasicCursor prefab is included for ease of use.
There is a cube in the scene with TapToPlace added on it.  Gaze at and tap the cube.  It will move along the spatial mapping mesh based on user's gaze.  
When tap is performed again, it will place the cube.

## [Utilities](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloToolkit-Unity/tree/master/Assets/HoloToolkit/Utilities)
Useful common concepts that you can leverage in your application.

### [Prefabs](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloToolkit-Unity/tree/master/Assets/HoloToolkit/Utilities/Prefabs)
Common useful prefabs not particularly related to a particular HoloLens feature.

#### Main Camera.prefab
Unity camera that has been customized for Holographic development.
1. Camera.Transform set to 0,0,0
2. 'Clear Flags' changed to 'Solid Color'
3. Color set to R:0, G:0, B:0, A:0 as black renders transparent in HoloLens.
4. Set the recommended near clipping plane.

### [Scripts](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloToolkit-Unity/tree/master/Assets/HoloToolkit/Utilities/Scripts)

#### Billboard.cs
Rotates a hologram so it is always facing towards the camera.

#### DirectionIndicator.cs
Show a GameObject around the cursor that points in the direction of the GameObject which this script is attached to.

You must provide GameObjects for the **_Cursor_** and **_DirectionIndicatorObject_** public fields.

**_Cursor_** The object in your scene that is being used as the cursor.  The direction indicator will be rendered around this cursor.

**_DirectionIndicatorObject_** The object that will point in the direction toward the object which this script is attached to.  This object can be a 2D or 3D object.

**DirectionIndicatorColor** The color you want the DirectionIndicatorObject to be.  The material on the DirectionIndicatorObject will need to support the color or TintColor property for this field to work.  Otherwise the DirectionIndicatorObject will continue to render as its exported color.

**TitleSafeFactor** The percentage the GameObject can be within the view frustum for the DirectionIndicatorObject to start appearing.  A value of 0 will display the DirectionIndicatorObject when the GameObject leaves the view.  0.1 will display when the GameObject is 10% away from the edge of the view.  -0.1 will display when the GameObject is 10% out of view.

#### FixedAngularSize.cs
Causes a hologram to maintain a fixed angular size, which is to say it occupies the same pixels in the view regardless of its distance from the camera.

#### Interpolator.cs
A MonoBehaviour that interpolates a transform's position, rotation or scale.

#### SimpleTagalong.cs
A Tagalong that stays at a fixed distance from the camera and always seeks to have a part of itself in the view frustum of the camera.

#### Singleton.cs
A base class to make a MonoBehaviour follow the singleton design pattern.

#### Tagalong.cs
A Tagalong that extends SimpleTagalong that allows for specifying the minimum and target percentage of the object to keep in the view frustum of the camera and that keeps the Tagalong object in front of other holograms including the Spatial Mapping Mesh.
